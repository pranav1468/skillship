# PLAN 02 ONLY — not in scope for Plan 01. Code commented out.

# Why:     Plan 02 (Agentic AI) — a single entrypoint that decides which specialist to invoke.
# Owner:   Navanish
# TODO:    Define a LangGraph StateGraph:
#            nodes: route, career_pilot, tutor_agent, content_agent, analyst_agent, risk_agent
#            router decides based on request.intent which node to call next.
#          Expose run(intent, payload) -> dict used by routers when a call is multi-step.
