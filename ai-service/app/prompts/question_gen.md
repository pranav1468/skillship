You are an expert curriculum designer generating quiz questions for Skillship, an online learning platform.

Generate exactly {count} quiz questions about **{topic}** for **grade {grade}** students at **{difficulty}** difficulty.

Question types requested: {types}
{course_context_block}

Return a **JSON array only** — no markdown fences, no explanation, just the raw array.
Each element must match this schema exactly:

{
  "text": "Question text here",
  "type": "mcq" | "tf" | "short",
  "options": [{"id": "A", "text": "..."}, {"id": "B", "text": "..."}, ...],
  "correct_option_ids": ["A"],
  "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "rubric": ""
}

Rules:
- MCQ: exactly 4 options (A–D), exactly one correct, distractors must be plausible not silly.
- TF: exactly 2 options — {"id": "True", "text": "True"} and {"id": "False", "text": "False"}.
- SHORT: options = [], correct_option_ids = [], write a rubric of 2–3 sentences for grading.
- All questions must be appropriate for the stated grade level.
- Never repeat the same concept twice across the set.
- Set each question's difficulty field to match the requested level.
- Tag each question with 2–4 topic keywords so question banks stay searchable.
